{"name":"Redmine issue evm","tagline":"Earned value management using the ticket of redmine.","body":"# Earned Value Management (EVM) Calculation Plugin\r\nThis plugin provides the function of calculating evm of projects . EVM can help you to track your project progress and its status and to forecast the future performance of the project.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Main features\r\n*\tCalculate EVM\r\n*\tChart with EVM (PV,EV,AC)\r\n*\tForecast project end date\r\n*\tSet the baseline\r\n*\tDisplay unfinished issues\r\n\r\n#### Additional options\r\n*\tExplanation of EVM\r\n*\tChart with Project Performance (SPI,CPI,CR)\r\n*\tCalculate EVM of multiple issues\r\n*\tChange the baseline date of EVM\r\n\r\n# How to calculate EVM\r\nThe below are used for EVM.\r\n\r\n* start date\r\n*\tdue date\r\n*\testimated time (If you set it as 0, you will not get PV, CV)\r\n*\tspent time\r\n\r\nIf you input these into your project, it can help you to calculate both a single issue’s EVM and whole project’s one.\r\nPV: Dividing estimated time by the days (from start date to due date) to get daily workload\r\nEV: After issues are closed, you can get EV.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n(1) Create an issue with:\r\n\r\n*\tstart date:  2015/08/01\r\n*\tdue date:  2015/08/03\r\n*\testimated time: 24 hours\r\n\r\nAt that time, only PV is calculated. As you have not closed the issue yet, EV equals 0.\r\nPV: Dividing estimated time: 24hours by 3 days (from start date to due date)\r\n\r\n| EVM | 8/1 | 8/2 | 8/3 |\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\n| PV  | 8   | 16  | 24  |\r\n| EV  | 0   | 0   | 0   |\r\n| AC  | 0   | 0   | 0   |\r\n\r\n(2) Input your spent time.\r\n\r\n8/1: 10.0hours  8/2: 6.0hours 8/3: 8.0hours\r\n\r\n| EVM | 8/1 | 8/2 | 8/3 |\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\n| PV  | 8   | 16  | 24  |\r\n| EV  | 0   | 0   | 0   |\r\n| AC  | 10  | 16  | 24  |\r\n\r\n(3) After finishing the issue, close it on 8/3. EV will be calculated on 8/3.\r\n\r\n| EVM | 8/1 | 8/2 | 8/3 |\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\n| PV  | 8   | 16  | 24  |\r\n| EV  | 0   | 0   | 24  |\r\n| AC  | 10  | 16  | 24  |\r\n\r\nBased on these data, EVM and chart are created.\r\n\r\n# Chart\r\n3 types of charts can be displayed.\r\n\r\n#### MAIN CHART\r\nShow PV,EV,AC with baseline.Display unclosed issues according to the baseline.\r\n\r\n#### PERFORMANCE CHART\r\nShow SPI,CPI,CR of the days involved with PV,EV,AC\r\n\r\n#### VERSION CHART\r\nShow PV,EV,AC of every version in the issue\r\n\r\n# Baseline\r\nIf you set baseline, you can know easily how project divergence is and whether new task (issues) can be added by chart. In other words, you can see whether your estimated daily workload is over or not by chart.\r\nPV is based on your baseline. In addition, you can set calculation without baseline by options.\r\n\r\n# Compatibility\r\nRedmine 3.1 and above\r\n\r\n# Current Version\r\n3.5.6\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\n#### Getting plugin source\r\ncase of zip file.\r\n\r\n* Download zip-file\r\n* Create a folder named redmine_issue_evm under [redmine_root]/plugins/\r\n* Extract zip file in redmine_issue_evm\r\n\r\nCase of git clone.\r\n```\r\ngit clone git://github.com/momibun926/redmine_issue_evm [redmine_root]/plugins/redmine_issue_evm\r\n```\r\n#### Migration and restart\r\n\r\n* Input the below command to migration\r\n```\r\nrake redmine:plugins:migrate NAME=redmine_issue_evm RAILS_ENV=production\r\n```\r\n* restart redmine\r\n\r\n# UnInstall\r\n```\r\nrake redmine:plugins:migrate NAME=redmine_issue_evm VERSION=0\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Screen shots\r\n#### Overview\r\n![evm sample screenshot](./images/screenshot01.png \"overview\")\r\n\r\n#### Baseline setting\r\nHistory\r\n![evm sample screenshot](./images/screenshot02.png \"History\")\r\n\r\nNew baseline\r\n![evm sample screenshot](./images/screenshot03.png \"New baseline\")\r\n\r\n#### Plugin Setting\r\n![evm sample screenshot](./images/screenshot04.png \"plugin　setting\")\r\n\r\n# Contributing\r\n1.
